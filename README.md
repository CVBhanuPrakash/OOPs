# Hotel Management System

This project is implemented in C++ and follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. I completed this project as part of my coursework in OOP. It provides a range of functionalities to manage hotel operations:

1. **Room Booking:** Users can book rooms according to their preferences.

2. **Customer Search:** Easily find customers by room number.

3. **Room Allotment:** Manage and view the rooms that are currently allotted.

4. **Customer Details Modification:** Update customer information as needed.

5. **Restaurant Food Ordering:** Guests can order food from the hotel's restaurant.

6. **Checkout:** Efficiently check out of the hotel.

7. **Automatic Bill Generation:** The system automates the process of generating bills, including charges for services used during the stay.
